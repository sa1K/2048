You can run the project from Driver.java

I have all of my must-haves that I said that I needed in my design document I have. I also said that I wanted color changing tiles which I was able to implement.

There was an issue where adding a new tile would take the spot of another tile, but that should be fixed. I haven't seen that issue since I made a fix.

There should be good javadocs for everything.
